    "Welcome to Week 1 of ECMM 6014, Databases, Data Warehouses and Data Mining For Electronic Commerce! If you got this far, it means that you have successfully launched and/or configured the Jupyter Notebook, likely using the Anaconda framework. Now that we are up and running, it is time to introduce you to some of the key concepts. Much of the material that we will explore in the first few weeks has been covered by [Sweigart (2014)](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). We are not going to rip off Sweigart's (rather excellent) book, but will build on many of the concepts he explores.\n",

    "**This week, we will achieve the following objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Run basic Python scripts\n",
    "- Assign Python variables\n",
    "- Perform basic string manipulation\n",
    "- Specify conditional controls\n",
    "- Loop across string characters\n",
    "- Defining Functions\n",

    "As you know by now, Python is a high level programming language designed to emphasize readability. There are many reasons why someone might want to use Python, though the main reasons why we have opted to use Python in this course is that it has an extensive list of data science libraries. In fact, you are likely currently using Anaconda, a set of Python tools designed specifically for our use case. \n",

    "Traditionally, the very first thing that people do when learning a new programming language is learn how to print `hello world!`. In Python, this is really straight forward. Try running the following code by selecting the cell and clicking `Run` (alternatively, you can select `shift + enter`)."

Comments are cool because they describe the code that you are executing, without themselves being executed. These are an essential part of writing good code because they tell other readers what the code does. It might seem silly at first, but once you start collaborating with other people you *will* understand the value of comments.\n",

In Python, variables can consist of many different types of data, such as: numbers (called 'variables'), decimals (called 'floats'), words (called 'strings), and more complex data structures which we will explore later. Using data stored in variables, we can create code that does virtually anything that we can imagine!\n"
